**analytics** helps you work with common web analytics services via API.

It currently supports:

- Google Tag Manager

Currently, the library doesn't provide access to every functionality for the respective services. It focuses on the most common ones. The main reason for developing this library is that some of the earlier solutions on GitHub have not been updated in years.

**analytics** can help you monitor, inspect, and automate some of your web analytics work.
